	<h3 class="content">Assignment #1: Installing XAMMP</h3>
      </a>
      <p class="content">
	This assignment was simply installing XAMMP on my personal computer so
	I could test my websites locally!
      </p>
      <a class="content" href="index.html">
	<h3 class="content">Assignment #2: Creating Your First Web Page</h3>
      </a>
      <p class="content">
	This assignment I created a basic website that included a main page 
	that explained the purpose of this index, an assignment index which 
	will give a brief description of each assignment and a link to them. 
	Finally, an about page to say a little about me. I used CSS and 
	javascript to make my life easier with the layout!
      </p>
      <a class="content" href="index.html">
	<h3 class="content">Assignment #3: Styling Your First Website with CSS</h3>
      </a>
      <p class="content">
	This assignment I originally had CSS in use on my index so I simply 
	improved the consistency to ensure the look and feel of the website 
	was reflected on all the elements.
      </p>
      <a class="content" href="dynamictext.html">
	<h3 class="content">Assignment #4: Dynamic Text</h3>
      </a>
      <p class="content">
	This assignment involved using a JSON data structure which contained 
	data about an article of rich text. I used the JSON file to produce 
	html dynamically using javascript and jQuery and apply CSS styling to 
	it. I also added a CSS drop down menu to improve functionality to the
	index!
      </p>
      <a class="content" href="dynamictableform.html">
	<h3 class="content">Assignment #5: Creating a Dynamic Table</h3>
      </a>
      <p class="content">
	This assignment consists of two parts. The first part was a user form
	which accepts four numbers from the user, validates them and lets the 
	user know what needs to be corrected if need be. Once the form is 
	submitted it processed on another page using JavaScript. The processing
	takes the user input using the GET method and creates a multiplication
	table with CSS styling.
